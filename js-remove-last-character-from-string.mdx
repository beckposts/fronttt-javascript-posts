In this post I'll show you 5 Methods to Remove Last Character From String In JavaScript using 
slice(), substring(), substr(), slice() with String.length() and split() and join().

## 1. Remove Last Character Using slice() in JS

How `slice()` method will work?

`slice()` method will extract a section of string and it will return it as new string.
It will not modify the orignal string. You just need to specify the start and end.

Example.

```javascript
slice(0, -1)
``` 

But what that it means? So you are telling slice to remove one character before the end of the string.

<CodeEditor id={1} markdownCode={`

const yourString = "Remove";
const newString = yourString.slice(0, -1);
console.log(newString); // Prints Remov

`} />

## 2. Remove Last Character In JavaScript Using substring()

The `substring()` method will return the part of string between the start and end index.
So to remove last character start at `0` and end at `yourString.length -1`.

<CodeEditor id={2} markdownCode={`

const yourString = "Remove";
const newString = yourString.substring(0, yourString.length - 1);
console.log(newString); // Prints Remov


`} />

## 3. Remove Last Character In JavaScript Using substr()

`substr(0, yourString.length - 1)` will remove last character, starts at 0 and uses the length of 
string length -1 as the lenth.

<CodeEditor id={3} markdownCode={`

const yourString = "Remove";
const newStr = yourString.substr(0, yourString.length - 1);
console.log(newStr); // Prints Remov

`} />

I won't reccomend this to use because substr() is considerd as a legacy function and it is not often used in modern JavaScript.

## 4. Remove Last Character Using slice() with String.length()

So I've already told you at the start to how you can use slice. I just want you to tell that this is also the way.
Funny ha?

`slice(0, -1)` and `slice(0, str.length - 1)` is almost similar ha..

Just we are getting the length of the string and subtracting one character from the end.

<CodeEditor id={4} markdownCode={`

const yourString = "Funny";
const newString = yourString.slice(0, yourString.length - 1);
console.log(newString); // Prints Funn


`} />

## 5. Remove Last Character Using Array Manipulation

We will use `split()` and `join()` for this. 

Note: This is not the efficient way for this task but I'm showing this beacuse there are different ways to get
the same result.

<CodeEditor id={4} markdownCode={`

const yourString = "Ignore";
const chars = yourString.split(''); // Convert string to array of characters
chars.pop(); // Remove the last character
const newStr = chars.join(''); // Join the array back into a string
console.log(newStr); // Prints Ignor


`} />

Do not use this method because it includes 3 steps and it is not the efficient way.

## Conclusion 

To remove the last character from a string in JavaScript all the above code will work.
You have the choice which one you're going to use and when depending on the project needs.

The most straightforward way is to use `slice()`.
